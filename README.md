# FlashLoan
Flash loans are a unique feature of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that allow users to borrow a large amount of crypto assets for a single transaction without requiring any collateral. The catch? The loan must be repaid in full, including interest, before the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
- Decentralized Finance(Defi)
- Solidity 
- Hardhat

## Development Setup
### MetaMask setup

- InstallÂ [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

### Network Configuration

1. Open MetaMask and navigate to the networks section.
2. Click on **Add Network** and enter the following details:
    - **Network Name:** Hardhat (Forked BSC)
    - **New RPC URL:** [http://127.0.0.1:8545]
    - **Chain ID:** 31337
    - **Currency Symbol:** BNB


### Creating Infura API Key

1. Go to [Infura website](https://app.infura.io/) and click the "Create New API Key" button shown in your dashboard
3. Under "Network," select "Web3 API."
4. Under "Endpoints," locate the "BNB Smart Chain Mainnet" option and enable it by clicking the toggle switch next to it.
