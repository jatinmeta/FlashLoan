# FlashLoan
Flash loans are a unique feature of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that allow users to borrow a large amount of crypto assets for a single transaction without requiring any collateral. The catch? The loan must be repaid in full, including interest, before the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.
